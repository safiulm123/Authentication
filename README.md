# Authentication
Very basic authentication structure created as a boilerplate for my projects. 

All the required packages are inside the package.json files.
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 After installing, Please use the following command to run the code
 
 ```
 npm start
 ```

Every week their will be similar kind of boilerplates
